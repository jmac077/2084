	Game.h

	The class is the central object of the game	application. It's a singleton
	so it is shared by all other game engine objects. It plays three important roles:

	1) It manages all major game subsystems like for dealing with graphics cards and input
	devices. The objects can be accessed via inlined public methods, i.e. getGraphics(), 
	getInput(), getClock(), etc.

	2) It initializes all subsystems in the proper order, using the settings found in
	the engine config file.

	3) It runs the game loop, calling the appropriate methods in the other major objects as needed. The
	runGameLoop method iterates once per frame, invoking all necessary methods needed each frame to run the game.

	NOTE: we have deliberately avoided making most classes technology specific. We would like to be able to change
	the way the graphics are rendered (i.e. DirectX or OpenGL) without having to change this or most other
	classes, but rather by simply swapping out the graphics object. Note that this class will construct
	the appropriate platform-specific sub-system based on what settings it finds in the config file.
